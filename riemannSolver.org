** Riemann Problem of Linear Hyperbolic System
The Riemann Problem in linear hyperbolic systems says:

P.D.E:
         \mathbf{U}_t + \mathbf{AU}_x = \mathbf{0},  -\infty < x < \infty and t > 0
I.C.:
         \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{U}_L,      x<0
         \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{U}_L,      x>0
	 
Solution Procedure:
1. Solve eigenvalue problem of Jacobian Matrix A to obtain
   - eigenvalue: \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < \cdots < \lambda_3
